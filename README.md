# FootyHunter

An in-progress game concept (stack not chosen yet).

## What is this?

FootyHunter will be a football/soccer-inspired game where you “hunt” for things—collectibles, moments, trophies, players, items, whatever the final design becomes.

Right now this repository is intentionally **minimal** so we can decide the tech stack and game scope first.

## Decisions we still need to make

- **Platform**: Web / Desktop / Mobile
- **Game type**: 2D / 3D / Text-based / Hybrid
- **Engine/framework** (examples):
  - Unity (C#)
  - Godot (GDScript/C#)
  - Unreal (C++)
  - Web (TypeScript + Canvas/WebGL)
  - Python prototype (Pygame)
- **Repo structure** once stack is chosen

## Next steps

1. Write a 1–2 paragraph game pitch (core loop + win/lose conditions).
2. Pick a target platform.
3. Pick an engine/framework.
4. Then we’ll scaffold the repo accordingly (source folders, build tooling, CI, etc.).

## Notes

- No code yet by design.
- Once we pick a stack, we’ll add a license, `.gitignore`, and proper project layout.
